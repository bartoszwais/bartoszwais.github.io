Funny confidence, Polish language, plural tablet, in Polish is 'tablety', same as plural pill(drugs category), in Polish slang.

Not sure if drug stores are selling tablets, could be treated as a tool in therapy, and be cheaper than on entertainment or business tax rate.

Cheaper for user, not for factory to produce, edited, can be cheaper for factory too.
video games and devices could be treated same way.
