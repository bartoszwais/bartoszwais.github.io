If vegan thinking, gov tax on meat, fish, eggs should be higher than on fruits & veggies (& muchrooms &spices).I have never checked if is in #Poland, and/or in other countries, not mentioning #EU.

Neither checked relation between vegan and pro abortion.

Additional gov tax on meat could help forrest/sea and agriculture or directly reduce price on selected products(negative tax).
