<p>Funny coincidence, Polish language, plural tablet, in Polish is ‘tablety’, same as plural pill(drugs category), in Polish slang.</p>

<p>Not sure if drug stores are selling tablets, could be treated as a tool in therapy, and be cheaper than on entertainment or business tax rate.</p>

<p>Cheaper for user, not for factory to produce, edited, can be cheaper for factory too.</p>

<p>Video games and devices could be treated same way.</p>
