<p>If vegan thinking, gov tax on meat, fish, eggs should be higher than on fruits &amp; veggies (&amp; muchrooms &amp;spices).I have never checked if is in #Poland, and/or in other countries, not mentioning #EU.</p>

<p>Neither checked relation between vegan and pro abortion.</p>

<p>Additional gov tax on meat could help forrest/sea and agriculture or directly reduce price on selected products(negative tax).</p>
